# Cookie RPG GUI

This is my first attempt at creating a graphical user interface for my text-adventure video game, Cookie RPG. I used the Tkinter library for Python to achieve this effect.

This game includes:
* 2 buttons
* A win/lose condition

Make sure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python from www.python.org") is installed on your device before opening this file. This game is played by using the Python terminal.

Future updates will include:
* Everything Cookie RPG has
* Prettier graphics
* Remove underlying terminal window
